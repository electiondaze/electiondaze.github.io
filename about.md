### More Information

Iâ€™m using this blog to be a record of learning R. From doing exercises/drills, EDA, and written summaries of my findings of public data.

I'll be learning from a variety of sources
  - Datacamp (link to custom cirriculum later)
  - Udemy
  - Coursera

The most beautiful thing about data is you can ultimately learn anything if you know how to explore.
